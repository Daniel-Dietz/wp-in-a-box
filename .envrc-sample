# rename it to .envrc
# place it at $HOME or root aka /root/


# EMAIL is used in multiple places
# - crontab
# - logwatch
# - as an alias for root in the server

export EMAIL=


# SERVER_IP is used in
# - nginx vhost (why do we need it, when we have a default vhost)
# - to setup PhpMyAdmin (why don't we have a subdomain to set it up?)
# probably get this using a script

export SERVER_IP=


# if the password contains '=' char, then it may not work as expected

export SMTP_USERNAME=
export SMTP_PASSWORD=
export SMTP_HOST=
export SMTP_PORT=


# WP_HOSTNAME=
# the server should be able to serve any domain hosted in a server
# server_name _; # nginx
# if the following value is set, then send 403 for all other domains

export WP_DOMAIN=


# create the following dynamically
# MY_SFTP_USER=sftprandom
# MY_SSH_USER=sshrandom

# set PHP-FPM in work in on-demand mode with a fixed set up max_children
# probably, you may calculate the max_childen depending on the total available memory in the server!
# ( total memory / max_memory in php.ini ) * 2
# on a 1GB server with a max_memory of 256MB for php, the max_children would be 4
